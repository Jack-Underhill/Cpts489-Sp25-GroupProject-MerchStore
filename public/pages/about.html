        <h1>About WSU Merch</h1>
        <p>WSU Merch is a website we built for our CPTS 489 Web Development class at Washington State University. It's a
            group project where we were asked to design a full online merch store, including products, cart
            functionality, admin tools, and more.</p>

        <h2>Project Purpose</h2>
        <p>The goal was to apply what we learned about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to a realistic website. We chose to
            create a WSU-themed merch store because itâ€™s something we could all relate to and have fun building.</p>

        <h2>Meet the Team</h2>
        <p>This project was built by a team of WSU students. We worked together to design the layout, add product pages,
            build admin features, and connect everything through a simple data system.</p>
